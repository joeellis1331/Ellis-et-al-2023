# Ellis-et-al-2023
Scripts utilized in the publication Ellis-et-al-2023

genomic GTF and FASTA files were obtained from Ensembl

STAR alignment, rMATS, and matt were all run using UF's HiPer Gator system. Example scripts are the same parameters
used in the runs except file paths are changed to be more general.

AS_overview.py is the script used to generate Supplementary Figure 4

RNAseq_MBNL1_curvefitting.py is the script used to identify, fit, and plot the 338 events skipped exon events in Figure 4E-G and supplemental file

validate_compare_RT_RNAseq.py is the script which plotted the RT-PCR curves on top of RNAseq data. Additionally all swarmplot style comparisons
were generated in this script as well.
