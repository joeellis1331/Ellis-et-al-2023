# Ellis-et-al-2023
-Scripts utilized in the publication Ellis-et-al-2023

-genomic GTF and FASTA files were obtained from Ensembl:
  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.101.gtf
  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa

-STAR alignment, rMATS, and matt were all run using UF's HiPer Gator HPCC

-AS_overview.py is the script used to generate Supplementary Figure 4

-RNAseq_MBNL1_curvefitting.py is the script used to identify, fit, and plot the 352 events skipped exon events in Supplemental File 1 and Supplemental file 2

-validate_compare_RT_RNAseq.py is the script which plotted the RT-PCR curves on top of RNAseq data for Figure 4B-E and Supplemental File 3. Additionally it conducted     all the regression analyses (Figure 4F-G; Suppl. Fig 5) and generated all swarmplots (Figure 4). See "curveValidation_inputSample_excel.xlsx" for input format
