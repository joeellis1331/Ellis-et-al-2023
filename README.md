# Ellis-et-al-2023
Scripts utilized in the publication Ellis-et-al-2023

genomic GTF and FASTA files were obtained from Ensembl:
Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.101.gtf
Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa

STAR alignment, rMATS, and matt were all run using UF's HiPer Gator HPCC

AS_overview.py is the script used to generate Supplementary Figure 4

RNAseq_MBNL1_curvefitting.py is the script used to identify, fit, and plot the 352 events skipped exon events in Figure 4E-G and Supplemental File 1

validate_compare_RT_RNAseq.py is the script which plotted the RT-PCR curves on top of RNAseq data for Figure 3 and Supplemental File 3. All swarmplots
were generated in this script as well (Figure 4).
